COMPUTERS are built using logic circuits that operate on information by two-valued signals labeled- 1 and 0 and these values are called bit - binary digit.
The most natural way to represent a number in a computer system is by a string of bits, called binary number.
A text character can also be represent is by a string of bits, called character code.


Consider an n-bit vector 
	B = bn-1 bn-2 ... b1 b0
where bi=0 or 1 for 0<= i <= n-1.
This vector can represent unsigned integer values V in the range 0-2n-1
V(B)= bn-1 * 2^n-1 + ... + b1 * 2^1+b0*2^0

We have to represent positive and negative numbers.
Three Systems Are used for representing such numbers:
1
2
3

In All three systems, the leftmost bit is 0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers.
Positive values have identical representations in all systems, but negative values have different represention.
In sign-magnitude representation  -ve values are represented by changing the most significant bit (leftmost) from 0 to 1 of the +ve value.
IN 1's Complement representation, -ve values are obtained by complementing each bit of the corresponding +ve no.
Thus -3 (3 - 0011) is 1100. similarly we can convert -ve values to +ve values by complementing the -v
e .
1's Complement : 2^n-1 1111 - 0011.
2's Complement : 1's Complement + 1.

0000 1000 
1111+1
10000

sign-mag and 1's Complement are natural comfortable easy for us.
2's Complement yields/gives us the most efficient way  to carry out addition and subtraction. use in PC


Binary Arithmetic Holds
1+1 = 10 0+0=0 1+0=1
